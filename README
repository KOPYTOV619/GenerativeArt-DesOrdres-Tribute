This work is something of a tribute to Vera Molnar, one of the first artists to work in generative art and her work Ordres (1974).

At the turn of the 60s it was not easy to become a generative artist, because computers were very primitive, took up huge spaces, and access to them was very limited. 
Despite this, and the fact that women at the time faced with rampant sexism in the workplace, there is a large number of generative artists, who have had a huge impact both on the trend itself, its popularity among ordinary people, and the community in particular. 

Aware of the general perception of computers as cold machines, Molnar spoke of the creative and humanistic benefits they gave her as an artist:
"Without the aid of a computer, it would not be possible to materialize quite so faithfully an image that previously existed only in the artist's mind. This may sound paradoxical, but the machine, which is thought to be cold and inhuman, can help to realize what is most subjective, unattainable, and profound in a human being.‚Äù
